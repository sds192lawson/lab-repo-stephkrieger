###### Question 1

In the code below, create a bar plot that visualizes how many home loans were for home purchases vs. the number for home improvements. Determine the variable that should appear on the x-axis, along with the geom function that can be used to create a bar plot. Fill in the blanks to ensure your plot has the appropriate context.

```{r}
#| eval: false
hmda_ms_2024 |>
  ggplot(aes(x = loan_purpose)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(title = "Home Mortgage Disclosure Act Applications, Mississippi, 2024",
       x = "What the Home Loans Are For",
       y = "Count of Home Loans") +
  theme_minimal()
```
:::

::: {.callout-important}
###### Question 2

Create a plot below that counts the number of applicants of each race. Be sure to give it a descriptive title and labels covering all 5 essential components of data context. You can use the code you wrote above as a template to get you started. You'll probably notice that the labels of your plot overlap. You can add `+ coord_flip()` to the end of your code to flip the plot so that the bars are horizontal rather than vertical. This should help with legibility.

```{r}
#| eval: false

hmda_ms_2024 |>
  ggplot(aes(x = derived_race)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(title = "Race of Loan Applicant in Mississippi, 2024",
       x = "Applicants Race",
       y = "Count of Applicants") +
  theme_minimal() +
  coord_flip()
```

:::

::: {.callout-important}
###### Question 3

In the code below, create a histogram that visualizes the distribution of loan amounts. Determine the variable that should appear on the x-axis, along with the geom function that can be used to create a histogram. Set the binwidth to create numeric intervals of 100000. Fill in the blanks to ensure your plot has the appropriate context.

```{r}
#| eval: false
hmda_ms_2024  |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = loan_amount)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 100000) +
  labs(title = "Home Mortgage Disclosure Act Applications, Mississippi, 2024",
       x = "Loan Amount ($)",
       y = "Count of Loans",
       caption = str_wrap("This histogram displays the distribution of home loan amounts requested by Mississippi applicants in 2024. The plot shows that the majority of applicants requested loans under $250,000. Since the average home loan size in the U.S. in 2024 was $252,505, this indicates that average requested home loan sizes in MS were smaller in comparison to the country as a whole.", 120)) +
  theme_minimal()
```

:::

::: {.callout-important}
###### Question 4

Create a plot below that shows the distribution of loan to value ratios (in intervals of 10). Be sure to give it a descriptive title and labels covering all 5 essential components of data context. Also add a caption to describe the percentage of a loan's property that borrowers most often request when applying for a loan.

You can use the code you wrote above as a template to get you started. Note that there were 20 outlier loans where borrowers requested more than double property's value. There was even one loan where the applicant requested 14 times the property's value. All of these loans were denied. Below I've given you some code to filter out these outliers in order to make the plot more legible. 

```{r}
#| eval: false

hmda_ms_2024 |>
  filter(loan_to_value_ratio < 200) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = loan_to_value_ratio)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10) +
  labs(title = "Home Mortgage Disclosure Act Applications, Mississippi, 2024",
       x = "% of Property Value the Borrower Requests",
       y = "Count of People Taking Loans",
       caption = str_wrap("This histogram displays the distribution of loan to value ratio requests by Mississippi applicants in 2024. The plot shows that the majority of applicants had loan to value requests around 75-80. Because when buyers put down more money it is a less risky loan, the mean loan to value being around 75-80 suggests these individuals are making more risky loan decisions.", 120)) +
  theme_minimal()
```

:::

::: {.callout-important}
###### Question 5

Create a stacked barplot below that counts both the race of the applicants and the action taken in regards to the loan. Be sure to give it a descriptive title and labels covering all 5 essential components of data context. I've given you some code below to move the legend to the bottom of the plot, to reduce the legend size, and to set the number of rows that appear in the legend. 

```{r}
#| eval: false

hmda_ms_2024 |>
ggplot(aes(x = derived_race, fill = action_taken))+
  geom_bar() +
  labs(title = "Action Taken on Loan for Applicants of \nDifferent Races in Mississippi, 2024", x = "Race of Applicant", y = "Count of Applicants", fill = "Action Taken on Loan") +
  coord_flip() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom",
        legend.text = element_text(size = 6), 
        legend.title = element_text(size = 8),
        legend.key.size = unit(0.4, "cm")) +
  guides(fill=guide_legend(nrow=4))
  
```

:::

::: {.callout-important}
###### Question 6

Copy the plot that you created above into the code chunk below, and then adjust the *position* of the bars to "fill" in order to normalize their height. Add a caption that summarizes your findings. 

```{r}
#| eval: false

hmda_ms_2024 |>
ggplot(aes(x = derived_race, fill = action_taken))+
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  labs(title = "Action Taken on Loan for Applicants of \nDifferent Races in Mississippi, 2024", x = "Race of Applicant", y = "Applicants", fill = "Action Taken on Loan",
       caption = str_wrap("This barplot displays the action taken on the loan dependent on the race of the 2024 Mississippi applicant. The plot shows that white and asian applicants had their loans denied the least, while American Indian/Alaska Natives and those of 2 or more minority races had their loans denieid the most. This could suggest that loan approval and denial rates have something to do with the race of the person applying.", 120)) + coord_flip() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom",
        legend.text = element_text(size = 6), 
        legend.title = element_text(size = 8),
        legend.key.size = unit(0.4, "cm")) +
  guides(fill=guide_legend(nrow=4))
  
```

:::


::: {.callout-important}
###### Question 7

Fill in the code below to create a boxplot that visualizes how the distributions of requested loan amounts differed across race. Add a caption that summarizes your findings.  

```{r}
#| eval: false

hmda_ms_2024 |>
  ggplot(aes(x = derived_race, y = loan_amount)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Home Mortgage Disclosure Act Applications,\n Mississippi, 2024",
       x = "Race of Applicant",
       y = "Amount of Requested Loan ($)",
       caption = str_wrap("These boxplots display the loan amounts requested of different applicants races in the state of Mississippi in 2024. The graph shows that asian applicants have a median loan amount higher than applicants of other races, and that black/african amerian applicants have the most amount of outliers. This could suggest that loan amounts have something to do with the race of the person applying.", 120)) +
  theme_minimal() 
  
```

:::

```{r}
hmda_denial_by_race <-
  hmda_ms_2024 |>
  group_by(derived_race) |>
  summarize(total_denied = sum(action_taken == "Application denied"),
            percent_denied = sum(action_taken == "Application denied")/n())

hmda_denial_by_race_sex <-
  hmda_ms_2024 |>
  filter(derived_race != "Free Form Text Only") |> #There were only 3 denials with free form text for race in MS in 2024, and they have been removed here for plot legibility
  group_by(derived_race, derived_sex) |>
  summarize(total_denied = sum(action_taken == "Application denied"),
            percent_denied = sum(action_taken == "Application denied")/n())

hmda_denial_by_race
```


::: {.callout-important}
###### Question 8

In the code below, fill in the blanks to set the height of each bar to the percent of individuals in a particular race whose mortgage was denied. Select a geom function to create a column chart. Be sure to fill in the correct labels.

```{r}
#| eval: false

hmda_denial_by_race |>
  ggplot(aes(x = derived_race, y = percent_denied)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(title = "Home Mortgage Disclosure Act Applications,\nMississippi, 2024",
       x = "Race of Applicant",
       y = "% of Loans Denied",
       caption = str_wrap("This column plot visualizes the denial rates of home mortgage applications in MS in 2024. The plot shows that Black or African American applicants, American Indian or Alaska Native applicants, or applicants of 2 or more minority races were all denied mortgage at double the rate of White applicants. This may indicate disparities in lending practices.", 120)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  coord_flip()
  
```

:::


::: {.callout-important}
###### Question 9

Copy your code above, replacing the `hmda_denial_by_race` data frame with `hmda_denial_by_race_sex`. Using the `fill` aesthetic, add the variable for describing the applicants' sex to the plot. Set the position of the columns to `"dodge"`, and be sure to add a label for the `fill` aesthetic. Adjust the caption to summarize your findings.

```{r}
#| eval: false

hmda_denial_by_race_sex |>
  ggplot(aes(x = derived_race, y = percent_denied, fill = derived_sex)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Home Mortgage Disclosure Act Applications,\nMississippi, 2024",
       x = "Race of Applicant",
       y = "% of Loans Denied",
       caption = str_wrap("This column plot visualizes the denial rates of home mortgage applications in MS in 2024 organized by race and sex. The plot shows that Black or African American applicants, American Indian or Alaska Native applicants, or applicants of 2 or more minority races were all denied mortgage at double the rate of White applicants. The plot also shows that White females, Black or African American females, and female applicants of 2 or more minority races are denied more frequently than their male counterparts. This may indicate disparities in lending practices.", 120), fill = "Applicants Sex") +
  theme_minimal() +
  coord_flip()
  
```

::: {.callout-important}
###### Question 10

Create a plot below that visualizes how many applicants *of each race* were denied mortgages *for each denial reason*. Be sure to give it a descriptive title and labels covering all 5 essential components of data context. You may wish to borrow some of your previous code to adjust the plot for legibility. I've given you some code below to filter the data frame to just those mortgage applications that were denied.

```{r}
#| eval: false

hmda_ms_2024 |>
  filter(action_taken == "Application denied") |>
  ggplot(aes(x = derived_race, fill = denial_reason)) +

###### Question 11

Below I've given you some code to produce a plot that visualizes the percent of mortgage applications that resulted in each action (e.g. loan originated, denied, etc.), broken out by the debt-to-income ratio of the applicant. Referring to last week's lab, add a line to this code to facet this plot by race. For which races was the denial rate higher for applicants with a lower than 50% debt-to-income ratio? Adjust the fact and interpretation presented in the caption with your response.

###### Question 12

Below I've given you some code to produce a plot that visualizes how the distributions of interest rates differed across debt-to-income ratios when loans were approved. Referring to last week's lab, add a line to this code to facet this plot by race. For which races were the interest rates higher even with lower debt-to-income ratios?

Median interest rates increased for borrowers with a debt-to-income ratio of over 50%. Additionally applicants of 2 or more minority races or are American Indian/Alaska Native tend to have higher interest rates despite have low debt-to-income ratio.

## Ethical Considerations

This dataset makes loan-level data about individual sensitive financial information available to the public. To reduce the risk that borrowers may be identified in the data, the CFPB removes certain variables before publication, such as the loan's unique identifier, the property address, the applicant's credit score, and any free-form text that the applicant writes on the application. Applicants do not have the option to opt-out of their data being disclosed in this dataset. If it were possible to re-identify individual applicants in this dataset, what would be the risks to the public disclosure of their information? Which applicants would be the most vulnerable? How should we think about the balance between the social value of this public data disclosure and the possible risks to those represented in it?  Share your ideas on our `discussions` Slack channel.
